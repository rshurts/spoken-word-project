**The Donkey**\
by G.K. Chesterton

When forests walked and fishes flew\
And figs grew upon thorn,\
Some moment when the moon was blood,\
Then, surely, I was born.\
\
With monstrous head and sickening bray\
And ears like errant wings—\
The devil's walking parody\
Of all four-footed things:\
\
The battered outlaw of the earth\
Of ancient crooked will;\
Scourge, beat, deride me—I am dumb—\
I keep my secret still.\
\
Fools! For I also had my hour—\
One far fierce hour and sweet:\
There was a shout around my head\
And palms about my feet.

\
**Psalm 22:2-12**

My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?\
Why so far from my call for help,\
from my cries of anguish?\
\
My God, I call by day, but you do not answer;\
by night, but I have no relief.\
\
Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One;\
you are the glory of Israel.\
\
In you our fathers trusted;\
they trusted and you rescued them.\
\
To you they cried out and they escaped;\
in you they trusted and were not disappointed.\
\
But I am a worm, not a man,\
scorned by men, despised by the people.\
\
All who see me mock me;\
they curl their lips and jeer;\
they shake their heads at me:\
\
“He relied on theLord—let him deliver him;\
if he loves him, let him rescue him.”\
\
For you drew me forth from the womb,\
made me safe at my mother’s breasts.\
\
Upon you I was thrust from the womb;\
since my mother bore me you are my God.\
\
Do not stay far from me,\
for trouble is near,\
and there is no one to help.

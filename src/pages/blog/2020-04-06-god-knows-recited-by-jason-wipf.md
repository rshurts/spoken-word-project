Full text of "God Knows"--popularly known as "The Gate of the Year"--by Minnie Louise Haskins...

\-----------------

And I said to the man who stood at the gate of the year:\
“Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown.”\
And he replied:\
“Go out into the darkness and put your hand into the Hand of God.\
That shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way.”\
So I went forth, and finding the Hand of God, trod gladly into the night.\
And He led me towards the hills and the breaking of day in the lone East.

*So heart be still:\
What need our little life\
Our human life to know,\
If God hath comprehension?\
In all the dizzy strife\
Of things both high and low,\
God hideth His intention.*

*God knows. His will\
Is best. The stretch of years\
Which wind ahead, so dim\
To our imperfect vision,\
Are clear to God. Our fears\
Are premature; In Him,\
All time hath full provision.*

*Then rest: until\
God moves to lift the veil\
From our impatient eyes,\
When, as the sweeter features\
Of Life’s stern face we hail,\
Fair beyond all surmise\
God’s thought around His creatures\
Our mind shall fill.*

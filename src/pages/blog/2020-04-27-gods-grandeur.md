**God's Grandeur** by Gerard Manley Hopkins

The world is charged with the grandeur of God.\
It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;\
It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil\
Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?\
Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;\
And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;\
And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil\
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.

And for all this, nature is never spent;\
There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;\
And though the last lights off the black West went\
Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs â€”\
Because the Holy Ghost over the bent\
World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.

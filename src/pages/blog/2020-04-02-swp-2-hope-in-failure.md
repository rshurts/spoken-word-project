Though now thou hast failed and art fallen, despair not because of defeat,\
Though lost for a while be thy heaven and weary of earth be thy feet,\
For all will be beauty about thee hereafter through sorrowful years,\
And lovely the dews for thy chilling and ruby thy heart-drip of tears.\
\
The eyes that had gazed from afar on a beauty that blinded the eyes\
Shall call forth its image for ever, its shadow in alien skies.\
The heart that had striven to beat in the heart of the Mighty too soon\
Shall still of that beating remember some errant and faltering tune.\
\
For thou hast but fallen to gather the last of the secrets of power;\
The beauty that breathes in thy spirit shall shape of thy sorrow a flower,\
The pale bud of pity shall open the bloom of its tenderest rays,\
The heart of whose shining is bright with the light of the Ancient of Days.

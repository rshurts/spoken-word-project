    The Spoken Word Project is our effort from Open Window Theatre to bring
    beauty and hope to the virtual sphere during the COVID-19 pandemic. Weâ€™ll be
    sharing weekly poetry recitations performed and recorded by OWT actors and
    staff. Please spread the beauty by sharing the videos, let us know if there
    are poems you would like to see included, and please consider a donation to
    support Open Window Theatre during this critical time. Thank you!

# Support During COVID-19

The world needs beauty in order not to sink into despair. Please consider a donation of any amount to help us keep the lights on and cover basic expenses during the coronavirus crisis so we can once again gather people this fall for **Season 7** at the new Open Window Theatre. Thank you!
